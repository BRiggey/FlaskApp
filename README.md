## Introduction

welcome to our ISAT 340 Final project! over the course of the semester we have learned many things in regards to database design. 
by using languages such as SQL, Python, HTML and CSS we were able to create a web application to allow users to interact with 
the database we have made. 

## Objectives
* create a repository on github to write our code and push and pull changes to the main
* make a log in page that requires valid credentials
* make html pages to design the web page display
* use [css templates](https://freefrontend.com/css-login-forms/#google_vignette) to establish an aethetic view for the web pages
* write python code to interconnect the databse to the html web pages
* create a profile information page that can be directly updated to the database
* create links between the web pages to display the database

## How to Use Our Web Application
1. once you browse the webpage you are greeted with a log in page. eneter valid credentials in order to continue.
2. youre then presented with a profile information form. here you can update information on your profile if desired.
3. below the form there are links. one will take you to view all the celebrities while the other displays one.
